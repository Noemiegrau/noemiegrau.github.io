These choices change the direction and often the outcome of the game. Our player can fight, but let's give them the option to skip the fight. All of the new code we write will go into the \u003ccode\u003efight()\u003c/code\u003e function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we begin coding, let's consider how we want to tackle this problem by answering the following questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat can we use to ask the player if they'd like to fight or skip the fight?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen would we ask them?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow can we tell the code pertaining to fighting to not run if a player chooses to skip?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can drive ourselves crazy thinking about all of the \"what if\" scenarios for our players, so it's important to think about the main functionality first. Even if the answers we come up with won't completely do the job, it gets us thinking critically about what we need to write into our program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some potential answers to the above questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can use a prompt to ask the player if they would like to fight or skip the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe should ask players towards the beginning of the \u003ccode\u003efight\u003c/code\u003e function so we know what they want to do before they do it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can use an \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement to check how the player responded and run the code to make the robots fight only if the player answers a certain way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's start by adding a \u003ccode\u003ewindow.prompt\u003c/code\u003e to the \u003ccode\u003efight\u003c/code\u003e function. Right below the first alert in the fight function, create a variable called \u003ccode\u003epromptFight\u003c/code\u003e. Assign to it the return value of a prompt that asks the player if they want to fight or skip the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe code should look something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"js language-js\"\u003evar promptFight = window.prompt(\"Would you like to FIGHT or SKIP this battle? Enter 'FIGHT' or 'SKIP' to choose.\");\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow when the \u003ccode\u003efight\u003c/code\u003e function executes, the player will get an alert welcoming them to the game and then asking if they'd like to fight or skip the battle. We're giving them explicit instructions on how we expect them to answer so that we can use the value stored in \u003ccode\u003epromptFight\u003c/code\u003e later in an \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"callout pause\"\u003e\n  \u003cstrong\u003epause\u003c/strong\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion:\u003c/strong\u003e How can we read back the response of \u003ccode\u003epromptFight\u003c/code\u003e to make sure it's working?\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnswer:\u003c/strong\u003e We can use \u003ccode\u003econsole.log(promptFight);\u003c/code\u003e to log it to the Chrome DevTools Console by writing it after we create the \u003ccode\u003epromptFight\u003c/code\u003e variable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we can get the player's input and use it to determine whether we fight or skip the battle. Think about this in terms of \"if this, then do that.\" If a player chooses \"FIGHT\", what should happen? If the player chooses \"SKIP\" instead, what happens?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are the two main answers we're looking for, but how can we stop a player from entering whatever they want? The answer is, we can't. So how do we handle a situation like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"callout nerd-note\"\u003e\n  \u003cstrong\u003enerd note\u003c/strong\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e User interaction can lead to unpredictable input and actions. A thoughtful developer builds a program that works under ideal conditions and then adds protective code to handle \u003cstrong\u003eedge cases\u003c/strong\u003e, where things don't go as expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now we have to make a decision. We could set up our program to explicitly check to see if our player chose to \"FIGHT\" and let anything other than that mean the player has chosen to skip the fight instead. This means that if a player were to respond with \"tomato\", the program would interpret that as the player wanting to skip the fight. This could be very confusing for the player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very least, it should be our job to inform them they made an incorrect decision and that our program isn't designed to accept an answer like that. So instead we'll do the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck if the player chose the word \"FIGHT\" or \"fight\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf yes (or \"true\"), then we'll continue with the battle and our robots will fight.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the player did not choose \"FIGHT\" or \"fight\", check if the player chose \"SKIP\" or \"skip\" instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf yes, penalize the player and end the \u003ccode\u003efight\u003c/code\u003e function.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the player did not choose any of the above words, then let the player know that they need to choose a valid option.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"callout important\"\u003e\n  \u003cstrong\u003eimportant\u003c/strong\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e Computers do not read letters as actual letters, but as binary data, which is a combination of ones and zeros (for example, the letter \"a\" is 01100001 in binary). This means that uppercase and lowercase versions of a letter are represented by different sets of binary code.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThe lowercase letter \"a\" is represented as 01100001 in binary code, but the uppercase letter \"A\" is 01000001. If a computer tries to compare uppercase \"A\" to lowercase \"a\", it will not find them to be a match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, we used control flow statements to take us in one of two possible directions. If the player had no health, let them know they lost. Otherwise, let them know how they're doing. Now we'll provide three possible directions. First we'll check to see if \u003ccode\u003epromptFight\u003c/code\u003e holds one value. If it doesn't, we'll check to see if it holds a different value. If it holds neither of the values, we'll simply take them in a third direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's update the \u003ccode\u003efight()\u003c/code\u003e function. Wrap all of the code we wrote that simulated the fighting between the player-robot and the enemy-robot into the following \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement. The following code should replace everything following the \u003ccode\u003epromptFight\u003c/code\u003e variable initialization up to the end of the function:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"js language-js\"\u003e// if player choses to fight, then fight\nif (promptFight === \"fight\" || promptFight === \"FIGHT\") {\n  // remove enemy's health by subtracting the amount set in the playerAttack variable\n  enemyHealth = enemyHealth - playerAttack;\n  console.log(\n    playerName + \" attacked \" + enemyName + \". \" + enemyName + \" now has \" + enemyHealth + \" health remaining.\"\n  );\n\n  // check enemy's health\n  if (enemyHealth \u0026lt;= 0) {\n    window.alert(enemyName + \" has died!\");\n  } else {\n    window.alert(enemyName + \" still has \" + enemyHealth + \" health left.\");\n  }\n\n  // remove player's health by subtracting the amount set in the enemyAttack variable\n  playerHealth = playerHealth - enemyAttack;\n  console.log(\n    enemyName + \" attacked \" + playerName + \". \" + playerName + \" now has \" + playerHealth + \" health remaining.\"\n  );\n\n  // check player's health\n  if (playerHealth \u0026lt;= 0) {\n    window.alert(playerName + \" has died!\");\n  } else {\n    window.alert(playerName + \" still has \" + playerHealth + \" health left.\");\n  }\n  // if player choses to skip\n} else if (promptFight === \"skip\" || promptFight === \"SKIP\") {\n  window.alert(playerName + \" has chosen to skip the fight!\");\n} else {\n  window.alert(\"You need to choose a valid option. Try again!\");\n}\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotice that at the bottom of the code block in the skip option, we send an alert notifying the player that the skip option has been selected. The third option will occur if neither the fight nor the skip option is chosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's save our \u003ccode\u003egame.js\u003c/code\u003e file and run our game several times to test each option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach selection should yield a different result based on the player response. If the player chooses \"FIGHT\" or \"fight\", we'll run the battle code that we wrote previously. If the player chooses \"SKIP\" or \"skip\", we'll leave the fight. If they choose neither, they'll be informed that they made an incorrect choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe used \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eelse if\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003eelse\u003c/code\u003e keywords to have our code choose one of three directions to go. The direction is based on the value of the variable \u003ccode\u003epromptFight\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's dissect some of this syntax, starting with our initial condition:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"js language-js\"\u003eif (promptFight === \"FIGHT\" || promptFight === \"fight\")\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep in mind that anything we put between the parentheses in an \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement will result in a true or false value, so when we put \u003ccode\u003epromptFight === \"FIGHT\"\u003c/code\u003e in there, we're checking to see if the value of \u003ccode\u003epromptFight\u003c/code\u003e is the word \"FIGHT\". Anything other than that value, different casing included, would result in the condition being false.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause we cannot always count on a player using all uppercase letters when typing the word, we also want to check to see if they entered the word \"fight\" in all lowercase letters instead. So now, within one condition check, we're seeing if \u003cem\u003eeither\u003c/em\u003e of these checks result in true. If at least one of them comes back true, then the whole condition is considered true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made this happen by using the \u003ccode\u003e||\u003c/code\u003e syntax, which is called an \"OR\" operator. When we use this in an \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement, we're telling the program to execute that code as long as at least one of the condition checks results in true. If both are false, then move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"callout deep-dive\"\u003e\n  \u003cstrong\u003edeep dive\u003c/strong\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e The OR (\u003ccode\u003e||\u003c/code\u003e) operator isn't the only logical operator available in JavaScript. To learn more, see the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators\"\u003eMDN Web Docs on logical operators\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what happens if the player doesn't enter \"FIGHT\" or \"fight\"? What if they type \"Fight\" instead? That would be considered false because we don't explicitly check for that permutation of the word. We'll explore other methods of fixing issues like this later in the game, but for now let's focus on what happens if the first \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement is false and the code doesn't run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the block (enclosed in curly braces \u003ccode\u003e{ }\u003c/code\u003e) holding the first \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement's code ends, we can see something new:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"js language-js\"\u003eelse if ([Condition])\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that if the first \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement fails, then try another one. If the first \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement is true, then we'll never get to checking the \u003ccode\u003eelse if\u003c/code\u003e statement. This is used as a fall-back condition check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our case, we're using \u003ccode\u003eelse if\u003c/code\u003e to do a similar check as our \u003ccode\u003eif\u003c/code\u003e statement, but now we're checking to see if the player wrote in \"SKIP\" or \"skip\" instead. But what happens if the player doesn't choose that either?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the player doesn't choose one of the values we've explicitly listed, then our code reaches the \u003ccode\u003eelse\u003c/code\u003e block of code. Think of the \u003ccode\u003eelse\u003c/code\u003e code as a default action if all else fails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"leave-the-fight-at-a-cost\"\u003eLeave the Fight, at a Cost\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have all of the important pieces in place to make this game interactive. They can choose their robot's name and decide if they want to go through with the battle, which will play heavily into when our robot battles multiple enemies soon. There is one issue with our logic, however. What is there to stop a player from skipping all of the fights and finishing with full health?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a hard question to answer, as there are a lot of different answers we can provide. We could penalize a player by subtracting health points upon leaving a fight, but that doesn't make too much sense, as the whole point of leaving the fight is to retain health for the next possible battle. So rather than measuring a player's success based on how much health they have at the end, let's measure it based on how much money they have at the end instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"callout nerd-note\"\u003e\n  \u003cstrong\u003enerd note\u003c/strong\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e Think about how old arcade games used to display \"High Score\" lists to rank players. Most games are not about getting to the end, but rather how high of a score they have when the game is over for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe'll finish this lesson by adding in functionality to penalize our player if they choose to skip a fight, so let's start by adding a variable to keep track of how much money they have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the top of \u003ccode\u003egame.js\u003c/code\u003e where we declared all our other player-based variables, create another one called \u003ccode\u003eplayerMoney\u003c/code\u003e with an initial value of 10, as the following code shows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"js language-js\"\u003evar playerMoney = 10;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe now can keep track of how much money our player has. This will come into play later in the game when we add the ability to purchase items, but for now we'll use it to penalize a player when they choose to skip a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's go ahead and add this penalty to our \u003ccode\u003efight\u003c/code\u003e function. If it should only happen when a player chooses to \"SKIP\" or \"skip\" the fight, where should we place it? It should go in the \u003ccode\u003eelse if\u003c/code\u003e statement that checks if the player chose one of those values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003ccode\u003eelse if\u003c/code\u003e statement, we'll add the following steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eAsk the player to confirm that they want to quit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf they answer \"yes,\" subtract 2 from the \u003ccode\u003eplayerMoney\u003c/code\u003e variable and create an alert that lets the player know they're leaving the game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf they say \"no,\" execute the \u003ccode\u003efight\u003c/code\u003e function to start the fight over again. This will give them the choice to fight or skip, so they can choose \"fight\" and keep playing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpdate the \u003ccode\u003eelse if\u003c/code\u003e statement so it looks like the following code:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"js language-js\"\u003e} else if (promptFight === \"skip\" || promptFight === \"SKIP\") {\n  // confirm player wants to skip\n  var confirmSkip = window.confirm(\"Are you sure you'd like to quit?\");\n\n  // if yes (true), leave fight\n  if (confirmSkip) {\n    window.alert(playerName + \" has decided to skip this fight.

You probably guessed that \u003ccode\u003ewindow.confirm()\u003c/code\u003e is a built-in browser function. Like \u003ccode\u003ewindow.prompt()\u003c/code\u003e, it asks the user for input and stores their response in a variable. But instead of letting the user enter whatever they want, it requires a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, as shown in the following image:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/526/files/486743/preview\" alt=\"Window confirm dialog that asks \u0026quot;Are you sure you'd like to quit?\u0026quot; with option to click \u0026quot;Cancel\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;OK\u0026quot;.\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://courses.bootcampspot.com/api/v1/courses/526/files/486743\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the user clicks OK, the Boolean value \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e is returned and stored in the \u003ccode\u003econfirmSkip\u003c/code\u003e variable. If the user clicks Cancel, the \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e value is returned instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about how we can use this for our game. If the player chooses to \"skip\" the fight, we should ask them to confirm that because it will make them leave the game. If they click OK, then the \u003ccode\u003econfirmSkip\u003c/code\u003e value is true and the game will end. Otherwise, the \u003ccode\u003efight\u003c/code\u003e function will restart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where the next part comes in, where we check a condition inside another condition. This is a very common practice in programming, and we can nest conditional statements as much as we need to—within reason, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember that with conditional statements, we're checking to see if something is true or false. So what is the value of \u003ccode\u003econfirmSkip\u003c/code\u003e if we choose to quit? The value is \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider the following two code examples:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"js language-js\"\u003evar confirmSkip = true;\n\nif (confirmSkip === true) {\n  // do something\n}\n\nif (confirmSkip) {\n  // do something\n}\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first example, we're directly checking to see if the value of \u003ccode\u003econfirmSkip\u003c/code\u003e is the Boolean value \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e. In the second, we're asking \"Is \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e true?\" They achieve the same results, but the second one uses less code and can also be used in other ways (which we'll see later).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we now run our program and choose to skip, we'll be asked if we really want to quit. If we choose to quit, then we'll have 2 subtracted from our \u003ccode\u003eplayerMoney\u003c/code\u003e variable's value and then, because there's nothing else to do, the program will end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the player chooses skip and then decides that they don't want to quit (i.e., they click Cancel), then the value of \u003ccode\u003econfirmSkip\u003c/code\u003e is false. This conditional logic asks \"Is \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e true?\". Because the player clicked Cancel, \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e does not equal true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"callout deep-dive\"\u003e\n  \u003cstrong\u003edeep dive\u003c/strong\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e We can use JavaScript conditional logic in a number of ways. Because JavaScript tries to define logic in simple \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e fashion, our conditions might not always fit that bill so easily. Luckily, JavaScript knows this and can do a little magic to make certain conditions and values result in \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThese are called \u003cstrong\u003etruthy\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003efalsy\u003c/strong\u003e values.

<p>Most round-based battle games give the player options to choose from throughout the game. These choices change the direction and often the outcome of the game. Our player can fight, but let's give them the option to skip the fight. All of the new code we write will go into the <code>fight()</code> function.</p>
<p>Before we begin coding, let's consider how we want to tackle this problem by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What can we use to ask the player if they'd like to fight or skip the fight?</p></li>
<li><p>When would we ask them?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we tell the code pertaining to fighting to not run if a player chooses to skip?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can drive ourselves crazy thinking about all of the "what if" scenarios for our players, so it's important to think about the main functionality first. Even if the answers we come up with won't completely do the job, it gets us thinking critically about what we need to write into our program.</p>
<p>Here are some potential answers to the above questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We can use a prompt to ask the player if they would like to fight or skip the fight.</p></li>
<li><p>We should ask players towards the beginning of the <code>fight</code> function so we know what they want to do before they do it.</p></li>
<li><p>We can use an <code>if</code> statement to check how the player responded and run the code to make the robots fight only if the player answers a certain way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start by adding a <code>window.prompt</code> to the <code>fight</code> function. Right below the first alert in the fight function, create a variable called <code>promptFight</code>. Assign to it the return value of a prompt that asks the player if they want to fight or skip the battle.</p>
<p>The code should look something like this:</p>
<pre class=" language-js"><code class="js  language-js"><span class="token keyword">var</span> promptFight <span class="token operator">=</span> window<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">prompt</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Would you like to FIGHT or SKIP this battle? Enter 'FIGHT' or 'SKIP' to choose."</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>Now when the <code>fight</code> function executes, the player will get an alert welcoming them to the game and then asking if they'd like to fight or skip the battle. We're giving them explicit instructions on how we expect them to answer so that we can use the value stored in <code>promptFight</code> later in an <code>if</code> statement condition.</p>
<blockquote class="callout pause collapse"><strong class="blockquote-title">pause</strong><div>
  
  
  
  
<div class="question"><p> How can we read back the response of <code>promptFight</code> to make sure it's working?</p></div><div class="answer" aria-hidden="true" id="pause_0"><p> We can use <code>console.log(promptFight);</code> to log it to the Chrome DevTools Console by writing it after we create the <code>promptFight</code> variable.</p></div><button class="hide-show-button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="pause_0">Answer</button></div></blockquote>
<p>Now we can get the player's input and use it to determine whether we fight or skip the battle. Think about this in terms of "if this, then do that." If a player chooses "FIGHT", what should happen? If the player chooses "SKIP" instead, what happens?</p>
<p>These are the two main answers we're looking for, but how can we stop a player from entering whatever they want? The answer is, we can't. So how do we handle a situation like this?</p>
<blockquote class="callout nerd-note">
  <strong class="blockquote-title">nerd note</strong>
  <p> User interaction can lead to unpredictable input and actions. A thoughtful developer builds a program that works under ideal conditions and then adds protective code to handle <strong>edge cases</strong>, where things don't go as expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we have to make a decision. We could set up our program to explicitly check to see if our player chose to "FIGHT" and let anything other than that mean the player has chosen to skip the fight instead. This means that if a player were to respond with "tomato", the program would interpret that as the player wanting to skip the fight. This could be very confusing for the player.</p>
<p>At the very least, it should be our job to inform them they made an incorrect decision and that our program isn't designed to accept an answer like that. So instead we'll do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check if the player chose the word "FIGHT" or "fight".</p>
<ul>
<li>If yes (or "true"), then we'll continue with the battle and our robots will fight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the player did not choose "FIGHT" or "fight", check if the player chose "SKIP" or "skip" instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>If yes, penalize the player and end the <code>fight</code> function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the player did not choose any of the above words, then let the player know that they need to choose a valid option.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, we used control flow statements to take us in one of two possible directions. If the player had no health, let them know they lost. Otherwise, let them know how they're doing. Now we'll provide three possible directions. First we'll check to see if <code>promptFight</code> holds one value. If it doesn't, we'll check to see if it holds a different value. If it holds neither of the values, we'll simply take them in a third direction.</p>
<p>Let's update the <code>fight()</code> function. Wrap all of the code we wrote that simulated the fighting between the player-robot and the enemy-robot into the following <code>if</code> statement. The following code should replace everything following the <code>promptFight</code> variable initialization up to the end of the function:</p>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that at the bottom of the code block in the skip option, we send an alert notifying the player that the skip option has been selected. The third option will occur if neither the fight nor the skip option is chosen.</p>
<p>Let's save our <code>game.js</code> file and run our game several times to test each option.</p>
<p>Each selection should yield a different result based on the player response. If the player chooses "FIGHT" or "fight", we'll run the battle code that we wrote previously. If the player chooses "SKIP" or "skip", we'll leave the fight. If they choose neither, they'll be informed that they made an incorrect choice.</p>
<p>We used <code>if</code>, <code>else if</code>, and <code>else</code> keywords to have our code choose one of three directions to go. The direction is based on the value of the variable <code>promptFight</code>.</p>
<p>Let's dissect some of this syntax, starting with our initial condition:</p>
<pre class=" language-js"><code class="js  language-js"><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>promptFight <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">"FIGHT"</span> <span class="token operator">||</span> promptFight <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">"fight"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that anything we put between the parentheses in an <code>if</code> statement will result in a true or false value, so when we put <code>promptFight === "FIGHT"</code> in there, we're checking to see if the value of <code>promptFight</code> is the word "FIGHT". Anything other than that value, different casing included, would result in the condition being false.</p>
<p>Because we cannot always count on a player using all uppercase letters when typing the word, we also want to check to see if they entered the word "fight" in all lowercase letters instead. So now, within one condition check, we're seeing if <em>either</em> of these checks result in true. If at least one of them comes back true, then the whole condition is considered true.</p>
<p>We made this happen by using the <code>||</code> syntax, which is called an "OR" operator. When we use this in an <code>if</code> statement, we're telling the program to execute that code as long as at least one of the condition checks results in true. If both are false, then move on.</p>
<blockquote class="callout deep-dive collapse"><strong class="blockquote-title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="deep_dive_3">deep dive</strong><div id="deep_dive_3" aria-hidden="true">
  <span class="deep-dive-heading">deep dive</span>
  <p> The OR (<code>||</code>) operator isn't the only logical operator available in JavaScript. To learn more, see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>MDN Web Docs on logical operators</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So what happens if the player doesn't enter "FIGHT" or "fight"? What if they type "Fight" instead? That would be considered false because we don't explicitly check for that permutation of the word. We'll explore other methods of fixing issues like this later in the game, but for now let's focus on what happens if the first <code>if</code> statement is false and the code doesn't run.</p>
<p>After the block (enclosed in curly braces <code>{ }</code>) holding the first <code>if</code> statement's code ends, we can see something new:</p>
<pre class=" language-js"><code class="js  language-js"><span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span>Condition<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p>This means that if the first <code>if</code> statement fails, then try another one. If the first <code>if</code> statement is true, then we'll never get to checking the <code>else if</code> statement. This is used as a fall-back condition check.</p>
<p>In our case, we're using <code>else if</code> to do a similar check as our <code>if</code> statement, but now we're checking to see if the player wrote in "SKIP" or "skip" instead. But what happens if the player doesn't choose that either?</p>
<p>If the player doesn't choose one of the values we've explicitly listed, then our code reaches the <code>else</code> block of code. Think of the <code>else</code> code as a default action if all else fails.</p>
<h2 id="leave-the-fight-at-a-cost">Leave the Fight, at a Cost</h2>
<p>We have all of the important pieces in place to make this game interactive. They can choose their robot's name and decide if they want to go through with the battle, which will play heavily into when our robot battles multiple enemies soon. There is one issue with our logic, however. What is there to stop a player from skipping all of the fights and finishing with full health?</p>
<p>This is a hard question to answer, as there are a lot of different answers we can provide. We could penalize a player by subtracting health points upon leaving a fight, but that doesn't make too much sense, as the whole point of leaving the fight is to retain health for the next possible battle. So rather than measuring a player's success based on how much health they have at the end, let's measure it based on how much money they have at the end instead.</p>
<blockquote class="callout nerd-note">
  <strong class="blockquote-title">nerd note</strong>
  <p> Think about how old arcade games used to display "High Score" lists to rank players. Most games are not about getting to the end, but rather how high of a score they have when the game is over for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll finish this lesson by adding in functionality to penalize our player if they choose to skip a fight, so let's start by adding a variable to keep track of how much money they have.</p>
<p>At the top of <code>game.js</code> where we declared all our other player-based variables, create another one called <code>playerMoney</code> with an initial value of 10, as the following code shows:</p>
<pre class=" language-js"><code class="js  language-js"><span class="token keyword">var</span> playerMoney <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>We now can keep track of how much money our player has. This will come into play later in the game when we add the ability to purchase items, but for now we'll use it to penalize a player when they choose to skip a fight.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and add this penalty to our <code>fight</code> function. If it should only happen when a player chooses to "SKIP" or "skip" the fight, where should we place it? It should go in the <code>else if</code> statement that checks if the player chose one of those values.</p>
<p>In the <code>else if</code> statement, we'll add the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ask the player to confirm that they want to quit.</p></li>
<li><p>If they answer "yes," subtract 2 from the <code>playerMoney</code> variable and create an alert that lets the player know they're leaving the game.</p></li>
<li><p>If they say "no," execute the <code>fight</code> function to start the fight over again. This will give them the choice to fight or skip, so they can choose "fight" and keep playing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Update the <code>else if</code> statement so it looks like the following code:</p>
<pre class=" language-js"><code class="js  language-js"><span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>promptFight <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">"skip"</span> <span class="token operator">||</span> promptFight <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">"SKIP"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<p>There are two things to notice about this code:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is <code>window.confirm()</code>?</p></li>
<li><p>Did we just use an <code>if / else</code> statement inside another conditional statement?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these might be somewhat familiar to you by now. You probably guessed that <code>window.confirm()</code> is a built-in browser function. Like <code>window.prompt()</code>, it asks the user for input and stores their response in a variable. But instead of letting the user enter whatever they want, it requires a simple "yes" or "no" answer, as shown in the following image:</p>
<p><img src="./3.1.8_ _Stay or Go_ with Control Flow_ Bootcamp_ UCLA-VIRT-BO-FSF-PT-02-2021-U-B-TTH_files/900-confirm.jpg" alt="Window confirm dialog that asks &quot;Are you sure you&#39;d like to quit?&quot; with option to click &quot;Cancel&quot; or &quot;OK&quot;." data-api-endpoint="https://courses.bootcampspot.com/api/v1/courses/526/files/486743" data-api-returntype="File" style="max-width: 594.023px;"></p>
<p>If the user clicks OK, the Boolean value <code>true</code> is returned and stored in the <code>confirmSkip</code> variable. If the user clicks Cancel, the <code>false</code> value is returned instead.</p>
<p>Think about how we can use this for our game. If the player chooses to "skip" the fight, we should ask them to confirm that because it will make them leave the game. If they click OK, then the <code>confirmSkip</code> value is true and the game will end. Otherwise, the <code>fight</code> function will restart.</p>
<p>This is where the next part comes in, where we check a condition inside another condition. This is a very common practice in programming, and we can nest conditional statements as much as we need to—within reason, of course.</p>
<p>Remember that with conditional statements, we're checking to see if something is true or false. So what is the value of <code>confirmSkip</code> if we choose to quit? The value is <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the following two code examples:</p>
<pre class=" language-js"><code class="js  language-js"><span class="token keyword">var</span> confirmSkip <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>confirmSkip <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// do something</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>confirmSkip<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// do something</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>In the first example, we're directly checking to see if the value of <code>confirmSkip</code> is the Boolean value <code>true</code>. In the second, we're asking "Is <code>true</code> true?" They achieve the same results, but the second one uses less code and can also be used in other ways (which we'll see later).</p>
<p>If we now run our program and choose to skip, we'll be asked if we really want to quit. If we choose to quit, then we'll have 2 subtracted from our <code>playerMoney</code> variable's value and then, because there's nothing else to do, the program will end.</p>
<p>If the player chooses skip and then decides that they don't want to quit (i.e., they click Cancel), then the value of <code>confirmSkip</code> is false. This conditional logic asks "Is <code>false</code> true?". Because the player clicked Cancel, <code>false</code> does not equal true.</p>

  <p> We can use JavaScript conditional logic in a number of ways. Because JavaScript tries to define logic in simple <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> fashion, our conditions might not always fit that bill so easily. Luckily, JavaScript knows this and can do a little magic to make certain conditions and values result in <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
  <p>These are called <strong>truthy</strong> and <strong>falsy</strong> values.
